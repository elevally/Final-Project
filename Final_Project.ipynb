    "A missile flying through the air can be considered a driven projectile in motion.  A missile propells itself by ejecting ignited fuel in the opposite direction of desired motion.  Other than this driving force, the only other forces acting on the missile are the forces caused by the acceleration of gravity, and the drag force.  Both of these forces depend on altitude.  The gravity at any given distance from the center of the Earth is given by the equation: \n",
    "$$g = GM/r^{2}$$ \n",
    "where G is the gravitational constant $6.67408 * 10^{-11}m^{3}kg^{-1}s^{-2}$, M is the mass of the Earth in kilograms ($5.972 * 10^{24}kg$), and r is the distnace between the center of the Earth and the object in meters.  The drag force is given by the equation \n",
    "$$F_{drag} \\approx -C\\rho A \\upsilon^{2}$$\n",
    "where C is the drag coefficient, $\\rho$ is the density of the air, A is the frontal area of the object, and $\\upsilon$ is the velocity of the object.  This equation depends on the density of the air, which we know has different values at different altitudes.  The density of the air at a given altitude is given by the equation \n",
    "$$\\rho = \\rho_{0} exp(-y/y_{0}$$\n",
    "where y is the altitude, $y_{0} = 1.0 x 10^{4}m$ and $\\rho_{0}$ is the density at sea level (y=0).  This gives us that the drag force due to air resistance is actually \n",

    "The boundaries of this scenario will be that the minimum initial velocity of each projectile will be 3,000 m/s and the maximum of each will be 3,500 m/s. The firing angles will be a minimum of 20 degrees and a maximum of 75 degrees.  The initial height of the missiles will be at least sea level, and at most 10 kilometers above sea level.\n",
    "A missile will be coming at us with a random velocity at a random angle, and the program will calculate and output the correct angle and speed that out intercepting missile will need to fire at in order to intercept the incoming missile at a maximum possible height. The output of the program should be an angle and a velocity."

This code neglects the change of air density at different altitudes, and the change in gravity at different altitudes.  The below code will be modified so that it no longer neglects these variables, and so that it outputs the components of the velocity at the given time, and its x and y coordinates at that given time."
