# Final-Project
The 12 steps toward rock solid scientific python code are
1. Use version control - Seriously, keep track of what you are doing, and have several versions to revert to if necessary
2. Put your code in the cload - Makes sense.
3. Add a Readme and a Liscense - know what you are doing, why, and make sure anyone you allow to modify your code also knows these things
4. Write docstrings - always know what your functions are doing
5. Write tests - best way to avoid debugging
6. Keep track of issues - keeps you from losing your mind
7. Automate the tests - you can't forget to run it if it does it on its own.
8. Automate the build.
9. Use continuous integration
10. Monitor test coverage
11. Write narrative documentation
12. Catch errors as you type them
What I hope to use my physics degree for is some form of engineering.  I want it to get a masters in mechanical, architectural, or areospace engineering.  I am very interested in classical systems that involve projectile motion, or statics.  That is why I am thinking of doing problem 2.3 from Giordano's text.  It expands upon what I did for my project 1, but also allows me to use some of the ideas and code I created earlier.  I will be using Euler's method in order to solve parts of this problem.  Another idea that I might be interested in is the patriot missle.  It is a ballistic system that intercepts incoming missles so that they cannot make contact with troops on the ground.  In order to do this problem, I would probably need the code from my cannon shell project, and also be able to determine exactly where a second projectile would come in contact with the initial one.
