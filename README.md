1. This code allows the user to calculate firing parameters necessary to intercept an incoming projectile a given time after it has been detected.  
2. The user can modify drag constants, initial velocities, angles, and times to interception.
3.  There are clear and thorough doc strings for each function, and everything necessary to run the program is contained within the file.
4.  The shooting method code block implements code that solves for the x and y components of velocity that will be required to reach a given final position at a given time.
5.  The friendly firing parameters code block implements code that converts these x and y componenets to a magnitude of velocity and an angle.
6.  The friend or foe projectile motion code block implements code that calculates, stores, and plots the trajectories of each projectile.
